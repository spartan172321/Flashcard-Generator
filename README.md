# Flashcard-Generator

1) Both the BasicCard.js and ClozeCard.js contains the modules for contructing basic cards and cloze cards respectively.

2) CLI.js accepts user input and uses the modules to contruct a series of basic or cloze cards that are then written onto the basic.json and cloze.json as a string of objects.

3) Should create another .js file to play the flash cards.
