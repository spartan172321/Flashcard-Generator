# Flashcard-Generator

1) Both the BasicCard.js and ClozeCard.js contains the modules for contructing basic cards and cloze cards respectively.

2) CLI.js accepts user input and uses the modules to contruct a series of basic or cloze cards that are then written onto the basic.json and cloze.json as a string of objects.

3) displayCards.js lets the player choose basic or cloze questions and they will be generated using the basic.json and cloze.json files respectively. Players are prompted to enter their answer after each question and the total right and wrongs are shown at the game end.
